# Scrape_Emails_From_Google

In this project I scraped business emails from google search, almost 10,000 emails on 1 search keyword.

Required Dependencies
- Scrapy
- Selenium
- scrapy-selenium
- re
- googlesearch-python

I also have implemented rotating user agent middlewares in this project so that user-agent will be changed for each request. If you want to add more user-agents then you can add then in list in setting.py file, or you can assign .csv or txt file to it.

If any problem then feel free to contact me via email: alwazan5228@gmail.com
